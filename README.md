# Cycle Statistic Tool Companion Mobile Application
A repository containing the source code for my undergraduate senior project at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. The [Cycle Statistic Tool](https://github.com/Jacob-Hoff-man/Companion/blob/main/Cycle%20Statistic%20Tool%20Abstract.pdf) is a data recording device attached to the frame of a bicycle. From this position, the Cycle Statistic Tool's network of sensors will collect live metrics about the vehicle. Subsequently, the data is transmitted to a companion mobile application that is installed on a userâ€™s smartphone. The Arduino hardware was [programmed using C++](https://github.com/Jacob-Hoff-man/Companion/tree/main/Arduino%20Hardware%20Code). The cross-platform mobile application was programmed using the .NET/Xamarin platform and C#.

The senior project [final report](https://github.com/Jacob-Hoff-man/Companion/blob/main/Cycle%20Statistic%20Tool%20Final%20Report.pdf) provides an overview of the Cycle Statistic Tool's engineering process.
# Senior Project Final Demonstration Video
The Cycle Statistic Tool final demonstration was presented on 04/20/21. A [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cTovEaKmmAo) made by the project team was used to demonstrate the project's functionality at this time.

Compiling Insructions:

You will need the following devices from the Arduio Device Manager:
	Arduino Nano IoT 33 Core

You will need the following libraries from the Arduino Library Manager:
	ArduinoBLE
	Adafruit_GPS
	Adafruit_EPD
	Adafruit_GFX
	SparkFunLSM6DS3

Delete 'main.cpp' from both the final and secondary microcontroller folders. Those files were placed there only for readability on GitHub. The files named 'final_primary_microcontroller_code.ino' and 'secondary_primary_microcontroller_code.ino' are equivalent to their respective 'main.cpp'.

Place both the /final_primary_microcontroller_code/ folder and /secondary_primary_microcontroller_code/ folder in /Documents/Arduino/

Open the .ino for the microcontroller that you want to program

Compile and upload code.

Comprehension:

main (primary)
	calls setup functions, polls BLE, and fires event-lists.


CSTDefinitions.h
	defines constants used throughout the code. includes bluetooth ID's, update frequencies, array indices
	
	
CSTExterns.h
	externs
	
	
display.h
	contains all of the code that operates the display. includes setup code and update code. just call updateDisplay(), the function will pull all necessary data.
	
	
PrimaryBLEHandling.h
	contains function for setting up BLE (adding services, characteristics, names etc.). defines handlers that are called by BLE.poll() in the main loop.
	
	
Stat.h
	simple wrapper that updates BLE characteristics and records a rolling avg.
	
	
updateEvent.h
	abstract class that is used to defines what happens when a sensor is updated. updateEvents should also update BLE Stats (and thereby characteristics) when new measurements are taken.
